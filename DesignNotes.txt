The 2nd page can be designed one of two ways, I can have it to where its just one big page that doesn't scroll and someone can answer the questions, and if there is additinal information that is needed, tthey would go to a 2nd page. 

    The 2nd design option would be having it designed similar to the first page where the user would have the option to scroll down and see different questions. 

    i sohuld be able to make the styled components once, and then import them into two different pages.

    For whatever reason, when i add the styling from the other button, im not albe to change the state like i would need. \
    

    When ensuring that the text can change when the user clicks a button make sure that the action / reducer matches with the state that is returned in the toggles.


    maybe insteading of asking all the different questions about the toggles, I can just have either the online coop and the online questions as parameters to determine which games are going to be the ones that are going to be displayed. If I was to have to many questions then I feel like that would take away from the experience - make it aitttle too long and drawn out. So. After the thid question, I could lead them to the page that would display all of the games that would be avaialbe to play. 

    I can already safely say that I've learned to use redux and React to make the webpage work. The next thing that i would have to figure out is using the backend or database perhaps to have the games display on the screen. Before I do that, I would like to display the games from the data that I alreaday have from the images I saved. Then once I get that working I can get something thats more dynamic in place.
