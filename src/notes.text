I need to look into creating a funcition at a later date that would use  
button.style.display = "none";
after the button is clicked. For right now, I would want the user to just click through the questions and to have the state working correctly. 

If someone where to click no on the option for the 
work on the next functionality for my fucntions in the api

Next step is to diplay some api information 
step after that is to connect the fucntionality from the buttons to what is in the API
